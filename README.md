github-colorify
===============

github-colorify is an extension for:

- [x] Chrome

that will add colors to the rows on your github timeline. This will allow you
to easily differentiate between projects because they will be grouped with the
same background color.

I couldn't find any license attached to it, hope that it's free, but if you
know the author let me know!
